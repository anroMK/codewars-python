# The search for Primes! Twin Primes!

## Problem

A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number—for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term twin prime is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair. (from wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a function that counts the number of sets of twin primes from 1 to n.

If n is wrapped by twin primes (n-1 == prime && n+1 == prime) then that should also count even though n+1 is outside the range.

Ex n = 10

Twin Primes are (3,5) (5,7) so your function should return 2!

### Solution
```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True


def twin_prime(n):
    prime_list = [num for num in range(2,n + 2) if is_prime(num)]
    return [(prime_list[i], prime_list[i+1])  for i in range(len(prime_list) -1) if prime_list[i+1] -  prime_list[i] == 2 ]
```
